An exercise demonstrating previous knowledge obtained via TOP

I am not possiive what I will have to make so far as I am just starting 
the project. I have this far been required to create a repository on
GitHub and clone it through the CLI.

I suspect it will ultimately reflect my ability to use HTML language,
particularly demonstrating the use of links and images, as well as text
formatting, and proper HTML etiquette (meta charset="UTF-8", priotizing
Alt text, etc.).

This project will also reflect my continued command of Git. I will leave
commit messages that acurately depict commit changes, and follow expected
formatting.
